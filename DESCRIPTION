Description: Contains tools to build deep neural network with flexible users define loss function and probability models. Several applications included in this package are, 1) The (deepAFT) model, a deep neural network model for accelerated failure time (AFT) model for survival data. 2) The (deepGLM) model, a deep neural network model for generalized linear model (glm) for continuous, categorical and Poisson data.
